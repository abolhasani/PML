Hi,
This is the readme file required for my (Sadegh Abolhasani u1416052) HW1
for CS 6190 Spring 23.


I have provided as much comment as possible.
P1 and p2 are mainly just plotting and calling t and beta pdfs with given args
P3: I have first drawn the samples, then formed two functions to return log likelihood
then computed the mle using L-BFGS-B (using minimize method) and formed the pdf.
After that, I plotted the results, added the noises and repeated the whole process.
